# Document-Classification
This is my mini-project
Here ,i integrate machine learning models in web application
prerequisites:

machine-learning:
1.sklearn
2.NLP modules
3.pickle

webapplication:
1.python-Django(2.0 framework)
  2.pickle
  3.re module
  
problem-defination:

Internet traffic and data is on an exponential rise these days. People are switching to faster ways of browsing the web aided faster proccessing speeds and Internet. Often articles on the internet are too long and cumbersome to read and comprehend. Using classification techniques of machine learning, it is possible to build a system which can simplify this process. The system will take as input a long  paragraph of text and predict what this text is about i.e give an overview of it, thereby
saving time of the users.

Instead of relying on manually crafted rules, content classification with machine learning learns to make classifications based on past observations. By using pre-labeled examples as training data, a machine learning algorithm can learn the different associations between pieces of text and that a particular output (i.e. tags) is expected for a particular input  (i.e. text).The first step towards training a classifier with machine learning is feature extraction: a method is used to transform each text into a numerical representation in the form of a vector. One of the most frequently used approaches is bag of words where a vector represents the frequency of a word in a predefined dictionary of words.So finally this algorithm  will be integrated with web application which allow user to know what category the text belongs to.



limits:
Due to lack ofdatasets it will work on few categeries :1.cinema(tollywood) 2.sports(cricket and football) 3.mobiles
